Schematic and board layout for [CadSoft Eagle](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/). The project file is for 6.5 but should work in newer versions.

###Note
The 8-pin DIN used isn't the exact type found on the DP60 (and therefore the original cabling). The DP60 has pins arranged in a U-shape (262 degrees) whereas the socket used is C-shaped (270 degrees). It's close and with a little force the cable can be made to fit. Sourcing a PCB mount U-shaped socket no longer seems possible (removing one fitted to a broken DP60 is an option, though the PCB would need altering accordingly).

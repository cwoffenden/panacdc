Schematic and board layout for [CadSoft Eagle](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/). The project file is for 6.5 but should work in newer versions.

###Note
The 8-pin DIN used isn't the exact type found on the DP60 (and therefore the original cabling). It's close and with a little force the cable can be made to fit. I couldn't source a socket with the same offset on the lower two pins.
